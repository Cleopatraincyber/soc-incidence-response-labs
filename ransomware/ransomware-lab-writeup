Ransomware Incident – SOC Lab Write-Up

Summary
This lab simulated a ransomware attack on a Windows workstation. My task was to identify the infection vector, analyze malicious activity, and recommend containment steps.
Key Findings
- Suspicious executable (`invoice_update.exe`) downloaded from a phishing email.
- Process spawned `vssadmin.exe delete shadows` indicating shadow copy deletion.
- High CPU usage from `encryptor.exe` encrypting user files.
- Outbound connection to a known malicious IP address.

Analysis Steps
1. Reviewed Windows Event Logs for process creation events.
2. Identified the parent-child process chain leading to the ransomware.
3. Used Wireshark to analyze outbound traffic to the attacker’s command-and-control server.
4. Mapped attacker behavior to MITRE ATT&CK techniques:
   - **T1059** – Command Execution  
   - **T1486** – Data Encrypted for Impact  
   - **T1041** – Exfiltration Over C2 Channel  

Containment Actions
- Terminated malicious processes.
- Isolated the host from the network.
- Blocked malicious IPs at the firewall.
- Recommended restoring files from backups.
